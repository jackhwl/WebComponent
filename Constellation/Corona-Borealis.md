Corona Borealis is one of the 48 constellations listed by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century. Its name means “northern crown” in Latin. This is an ancient constellation that has its roots in many cultures. It has been depicted as a circle of elders, an eagle’s nest, and a bear’s den. In Celtic mythology, it was known as Caer Arianrhod, the Castle of Arianrhod. It represented the home of the Lady Arianrhod. In Greek mythology, it represented the crown that Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos of Crete, wore at her wedding. Her ball of thread helped Theseus defeat the Minotaur and find his way out of the labyrinth. Theseus gave her the crown when they married. The crown was created by the supreme goldsmith of the gods, Hephaestus.
