## Portfolio Return
## The Ultimate Objective
  * High POPs -> OTM short premium
  * Mechanical Adjustments -> turn losers into winners
  * Strategic Diversification -> different markets, different strategies

 This is are all pieces to the puzzle, but the puzzle itself is portfolio

## When the Dust Settles
 We constantly compare expected outcomes with realized results:
  * IV vs RV -> implied volatility "overstated"
  * POP vs POP* -> ex ante and ex post*
  * ROC vs P/L -> ROC on way in, profit on way out

  So how do ROCs help inform eventual portfolio returns?

2. Expected vs. Realized
