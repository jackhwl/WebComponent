## How I decide to close a trade
   * Undefind risk: $2.00 credit, close at $6.00, 2 times credit close.
   * Defined risk: 
       * if it's a narrow spread, let it ride, close before expiration to avoid assignment fee.
                $1.00 credit, $3 wide, hopeful I can close it at $2.50, to avoid maxium lost $2.00
                if stock close to short position roll if u could get credit;
       * if it's a wider spread, $1.50 credit for $10.00 wide, will close it at $4.50 same as previous one
       * rolling is harder with defined risk
## How to avoid locking in losses when rolling
   * Be aware of breakeven when selling srikes
   * We can go below our stock ownership, but must collect enough to move breakeven in our favor
   * Locking in losses isn't the worst possible situation, but it's surely not the best!
## Defensive Tactics
   * Q: What are some signs that we need to play defense?
     * The trade has reached an uncomfortable level of expected succes (POP less that 33%)
     * Generally the trade has gone one to two times past an equivalent profit target.($1 credit vs $2-$3 lost)
     * Adding more is not an option
     * Have a willingness to add duration but not capital
   * Q: If tested, is there any way we can adjust the trade?
   * A: We may look to roll one leg of our position in order to collect additional premium and widen out breakeven points. We have found the most beneficial way to take advantage of this is to roll the untested side to your original probability as shown below:

        |SPY|Roll Tested<br>Up|Roll Tested<br>Out|Roll Tested<br>Out and Up|*Roll UnTested<br>Up*|No Management|

        Avg. Days Held|36|72|72|**36**|47 

   * Q: Do we roll defined risk trades?
   * A: Primarily we are comfortable with max loss on a defined risk trade and allow our probabilities to play out. For this reason, we normally do not roll defined risk trades. However, we will look to roll a spread if we are "on the dance floor" (short strike ITM/ATM and long strike OTM). when it on the dance floor, it's 50/50 shot for going higher or lower, so stay with it.
