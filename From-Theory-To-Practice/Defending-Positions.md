## How I decide to close a trade
   * Undefind risk: $2.00 credit, close at $6.00, 2 times credit close.
   * Defined risk: 
       * if it's a narrow spread, let it ride, close before expiration to avoid assignment fee.
                $1.00 credit, $3 wide, hopefull can close it $2.50, to avoid maxium lost $2.00
                if stock close to short position roll if u could get credit;
       * if it's a wider spread, $1.50 credit for $10.00 wide, will close it at $4.50 same as previous one
       * rolling is harder with defined risk
