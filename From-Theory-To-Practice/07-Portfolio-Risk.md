## The Other Side
 Portfolio returns are the objective, but we can't ignore portfolio risk:
   * Risk? -> Standard Deviation, Implied Volatility, etc.
   * Generally speaking? -> movements and fluctuations
   * Less is more -> always prefer smoother ride

   * Always correct -> movements and fluctuations
   * Brokerage perspective? -> buying power is key
   * Combine the two -> the fluctuations of buying power
